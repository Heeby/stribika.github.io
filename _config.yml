  You attempted to reach stribnet.github.io, but instead you actually reached a
  server identifying itself as a shape shifter humanoid reptile alien. This may
  be caused by a misconfiguration on the server or something more serious. An
  attacker on your network could be trying to get you to visit a fake (and
  definitely harmful) version of stribnet.github.io. You should not proceed.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
