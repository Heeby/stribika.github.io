In this July, blogger Yasha Levine published a [blockbuster][pando-bullshit] story in conjunction with Pando Daily.
They had obtained leaked unclassified Tor documents showing that almost everyone involved in developing Tor was funded by the US government.

TODO: insert bullshit about people thinking pando is cool

It's a nice story, pitting investigative journalists against the all-powerful US Imperial machine.
But the facts about Pando are not as clear cut or simple as these folks make them out to beâ€¦

Let's start with the basics:
Pando was [written, built and financed][pando-greylock] by the [US torture-surveillance complex][inqtel-cia].
Pando's original - and current - purpose is to convince citizens to reveal their online identities for government agents and informants: spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt about privacy technology, giving signals intelligence agents a way to voluntarily de-anonymize the general public - that kind of thing.
This information is out there, but it's not very well known, and it's certainly not emphasized by those who promote it.

Peek under Pando's hood, and you quickly realize that just about everybody involved in writing Pando articles has been and/or is funded by the Pentagon or related arm of the US empire.
This includes Yasha Levine, who wrote the first Tor article under a series of military and federal government contracts.

If you search the Internet for [Howard Cox][greylock-howardcox-inqtel], you'll see that he is still very much both a board member of In-Q-Tel, a private sector branch of the CIA, *and* a special partner at Greylock, the venture capital firm financing Pando.
